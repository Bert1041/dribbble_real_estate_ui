# Real Estate App - Design-to-Code Test

This is my submission for the design-to-code test, where I was tasked with translating a Dribbble design of a real estate app into a working mobile application.

## Project Overview

The goal was to accurately replicate the UI design, animations, and scroll behaviors from the Dribbble video into a fully functional mobile app. All screens and interactions visible in the video have been implemented.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK (v3.16 or higher)
- Dart (v3.2 or higher)

## Known Limitations

- Some animations may not be 100% frame-perfect compared to the Dribbble prototype
- Font weights are approximate due to licensing constraints
- Image loading could benefit from additional optimization
